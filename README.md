- **Interact**: Click anywhere on the canvas to add new stars
- **Responsive**: The simulation automatically adjusts to different screen sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `sketch.js` to modify:
- Background color (line ~24)
- Planet colors (in the Planet constructor)
- Star brightness and twinkling speed

### Adding More Planets

Add more planets in the `setup()` function:

```javascript
planets.push(new Planet(x, y, radius, color(r, g, b)));
```

### Modifying Star Field

Adjust the number of stars or their properties in the `setup()` function:

```javascript
// Change 200 to any number you want
for (let i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
```
